# Placement-status-of-univeristy-students-prediction
It is important for a university to give placements to the students. The major factors which is influencing placement is very important for a university to train according to that. This Data set provides us the information about the acedamic details of student. From the given academic detail "The Problem Statement is to Predict the Status of the student in terms of placement wheather the student got placed through campus or not?






This is Binary Classification Problem beacuse there are two labels in our target variable saying wheather student got placed or not.

After Building a model, The main was to focus on the factors that are influencing placement the most. From that ,It will be easy for University to train students accordingly.

# INTERPRETATION



1. First find best parameter in Random Forest using hyper Parameter Tuning.
2. Fit a model using parameter and find  5 best features
3. Using the fined tunned parameter and 5 best features, again rebuild the model to get 100 % percent accuracy of predicting wheather the student is placed or not.


# CONCLUSION

1. Percentage of degree in both hsc,ssc and pg are important to get placed
2. Specialization of the cource studied is important.
3. Students of other domains other than MBA have to be train well to get placement.
4. All the internal and external marks are important to get place.
